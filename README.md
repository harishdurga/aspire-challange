### Authentication
For Authetication *Laravel Sanctum* has been used as it's very easy to implement and suitable for apis.
#### Admin Credentials
**email**:admin@admin.com, **passowrd**:Test@2022

### Request Validation
For most of the post request validation, custom form request classes have been created to keep the controller methods clean.  `FailedValidationJsonResponse` trait has been added to all the custom form requests to be able to send response in json format in case of failed validation.

### Testing
To run tests we can either run `vendor/bin/phpunit` or `php artisan test`

### API Resources
Laravel `APIResource` and `ResourceCollection` classes have been used to transform the models and send json response.

### Model Relationships
- `TermLoan` belongs to `User`
- `TermLoan` has many `TermLoanRepayment`
- `TermLoanRepayment` belongs to `TermLoan`

### APIS
#### Approving The Loan
Only with a token that is generated by using the admin credentials one will be able to approve/reject the loan.
